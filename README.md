# Mental Health Management App (Tranquil)

This repository is an MSc Dissertation project that contains the code for Tranquil, a mobile application for mental health management.

This project utilises the potential of mobile technology to offer assistance to patients and individuals while serving as an extension of therapy. The application offers a diverse range of features dedicated to monitoring, evaluating and supporting individuals with mental health issues. Here is an outline of the features and their effects: The AI chatbot is a central component of the mental health app, serving multiple roles. It is a friendly companion that can improve the mood of the user and offer insightful information for your mental health needs. The symptom tracker and depression test are tools for individuals or patients to monitor their moods and results over time. By consistently monitoring mood fluctuations, individuals can track the effectiveness of their treatments and detect patterns. The inclusion of visual charts provides a visual representation of the collected data. Additionally, the app will incorporate a medication reminder to aid in medication adherence.

The application was designed in Figma and coded in React Native. The main screens are as follows:
